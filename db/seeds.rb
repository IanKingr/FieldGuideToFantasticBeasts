  description: "A Troll is a magical creature of prodigious strength and immense stupidity. In fact, they are so stupid that they actually had a wizarding exam failing grade named after them. Trolls are grouped in the taxonomical genus Troglodytarum.

  Mountain Trolls are a larger breed of troll, and generally reaching a height of about twelve feet and weighing over a tonne. Troll whiskers have magical properties, and are sometimes used as wand cores. Their feet have two toes, both with giant toenails.

  They are dangerously violent and incredibly aggressive, engaging in unpredictable behaviour, comparable to giants. They are also incredibly low in intelligence, to which giants seem to have more of.",

Griffins are known as fierce creatures, however, despite this, skilled Wizards have been able to befriend them. Griffins are often used by wizards as guards of treasure, like Sphinxes.",

  description: "A lean, muscular 7 foot tall Gnoll can be an imposing sight. Despite their musculature they move rather quickly, easily outpacing most other races. Gnolls also outpace most other races in how quickly they mature. A Gnoll matures by the age of 5 and lives to be about 30.

  Gnolls have reflective eyes that are typically bright green or yellow. They also have a thick coat of fur, which is generally light brown or dark brown. Certain clans may posses a single-colored coat or a spotted or striped coat. Some Gnolls possess crestlike manes of hair going from their head down their spine which rise up they become frightened or angry.

  Adding to other races distrust about Gnolls, occasionally a Gnoll's demonic ancestry will result in peculiar physical traits. This might be manifested in the claws of Gnoll Claw Fighters or in abnormal eye or coat colors.",

  name: "Kobold",
  description: "Kobolds are dinosaur-like reptilian humanoids that are extremely dexterous and clever trapmakers.

  Males are about three inches taller and 5 kilograms heavier than most females. Their hides are typically a rust-brown or reddish black color, with ivory-colored horns. Their heads are described as dog-like, but in recent editions they are illustrated as looking more like crocodiles. Their eyes glow red, and they can see accurately even in lightless conditions up to 60 feet away. Kobolds are described as smelling like a cross between damp dogs and stagnant water.

  Unlike dragons, kobolds are cold-blooded. The scales covering their bodies are like that of an iguana or other large lizard. The scales that cover their tails are very fine, so that they resemble the naked tails of rats. Kobolds lose and gain new teeth throughout their lives, often saving and making necklaces from them. Kobolds favor raggedy-looking red or orange clothing made from leather or the silk of giant spiders. They never wear shoes, but they are fond of jewelry and other ornamentation.

  Kobolds shed their skin about once a season, in patches, over the course of a week. They keep themselves well-groomed, regularly polishing their horns, claws, and teeth.",

  name: "Goblin",
  description: "Goblins are a race of small and numerous goblinoids common throughout the land, often living in underground caverns near the surface known as lairs. Goblins, like other goblinoids, have a commonly short temper and are best avoided even in the best of circumstances. They have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, and small, sharp fangs. Their foreheads slope back, and their eyes vary in color from red to yellow. Their skin color ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of the same tribe share the same colored skin, though they also come in shades of green.

  Goblins do not get along well with most other races and are particularly suspicious of other goblinoids. Goblins have a somewhat ambivalent relationship with orcs and half-orcs, who they've worked with on occasion, but the only true allies of the goblin race are worgs, who often act as mounts and fighting companions for goblins. Goblins have a particularly adverse relationship with both Tel-quessir and dwarves.",

  description: "Native to Greece, the Hippocampus is a beast with the head and forequarters of a horse, and the tail and hindquarters of a giant fish, making it somewhat similar in appearance to an over-sized seahorse. Although it is generally found in the Mediterranean, a blue roan specimen was caught by Merpeople off the coast of Scotland in 1949 and domesticated.

  Hippocampus lay large, semi-transparent eggs through which the young hippocampus, known as a Tadfoal, can be seen. Hippocampus is derived from the words \"hippos\" means \"horse\" and \"kampos\" means \"sea monster\"",

  name: "Kracken",
  description: "The Kracken is a large, ocean-dwelling magical beast. It is akin to a squid the size of a house measuring over 60 feet tall and wide. Its body is similar to that of a squid, with a ring of tentacles surrounding a mouth connected to a conical central body. Two of its 10 tentacles are longer than the rest, and bear deadly barbs. The kraken has very large eyes, and fins protrude from the upper part of its elongated central body.

  Krakens are highly destructive and evil creatures. With their strong tentacles and massive strength, they can pull an entire ship down into the ocean. They have often completely wiped tropical islands of all life, and deep beneath the ocean, they have cavernous lairs where they keep human slaves to feed and tend them. Krakens were supposedly once the rulers of the sea, but eventually the forces of good drove them back, though legends say they will one day rise again. Krakens attack predominantly with their tentacles. They can both constrict opponents, and bring them into the reaches of the creature's huge jaws. In addition, Krakens can also release an enormous cloud of jet-black ink, and can even cast spells. It also regenerates severed limbs.

  Krakens cannot speak the languages of surface dwelling races, but might speak Aquan, or a language of their own similar to that of whales.",

  A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young. A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any medium-sized or larger creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings.",

Despite this, they have other avian features as well, their lower legs are feathered instead of furred and their manes and tails are also of feathers.

  Along with their physical attributes, pegasi are also like birds in that they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young. A pegasus will mature at the same rate as a horse, however, and have somewhat similar habits.

  Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures that are not easily tamed. It is also believed that pegasi can sense a person's nature and will only allow the good-hearted near.",
